# ePuck RGB Measurement & Keyboard Control Project

## Description
This project allows you to **control the ePuck robot with the keyboard while measuring RGB values** from the surface below it. 
The robot uses its camera to capture the color at the center of the image and prints the RGB values in real-time.

The robot can be controlled with the **W, A, S, D keys**:
- W: Move forward  
- S: Move backward  
- A: Turn left  
- D: Turn right  

If no key is pressed, the robot stops.
